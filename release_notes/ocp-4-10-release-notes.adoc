[id="ocp-4-10-conditional-updates"]
==== Conditional updates

{product-title} 4.10 adds support for consuming conditional update paths provided by the OpenShift Update Service.
Conditional update paths convey identified risks and the conditions under which those risks apply to clusters.
The Administrator perspective on the web console only offers recommended upgrade paths for which the cluster does not match known risks.
However, OpenShift CLI (`oc`) 4.10 or later can be used to display additional upgrade paths for {product-title} 4.10 clusters.
Associated risk information including supporting documentation references is displayed with the paths.
The administrator may review the referenced materials and choose to perform the supported, but no longer recommended, upgrade.

For more information, see xref:../updating/understanding-upgrade-channels-release.adoc#conditional-updates-overview_understanding-upgrade-channels-releases[Conditional updates] and xref:../updating/updating-cluster-cli.adoc#update-conditional-upgrade-pathupdating-cluster-cli[Updating along a conditional upgrade path].

[id="ocp-4-10-web-console"]
=== Web console

[id="pod-debug-mode-web-console"]
==== Running a pod in debug mode
With this update, you can now view debug terminals in the web console. When a pod has a container that is in a `CrashLoopBackOff` state, a debug pod can be launched. A terminal interface is displayed and can be used to debug the crash looping container.

* This feature can be accessed by the pod status pop-up window, which is accessed by clicking on the status of a pod, provides links to debug terminals for each crash looping container within that pod.
* You can also access this feature on the *Logs* tab of the pod details page. A debug terminal link is displayed above the log window when a crash looping container is selected.

Additionally, the pod status pop-up window now provides links to the *Logs* and *Events* tabs of the pod details page.

[id="web-console-customized-workload-notifications"]
==== Customized workload notifications
With this update, you can customize workload notifications on the *User Preferences* page. *User workload notifications* under the *Notifications* tab allows you to hide user workload notifications that appear on the *Cluster Overview* page or in your drawer.

[id="improved-quota-visibility-web-console"]
==== Improved quota visibility
With this update, non-admin users are now able to view their usage of the `AppliedClusterResourceQuota` on the *Project Overview*, *ResourceQuotas*, and *API Explorer* pages in order to determine the cluster-scoped quota available for use. Additionally, `AppliedClusterResourceQuota` details can now be found on the *Search* page.

[id="listing-pods-targeted-network-policies"]
==== Listing pods targeted by network policies
When using the network policy functionality in the {product-title} web console, the pods that are affected by a policy are listed. The list updates as the combined namespace and pod selectors in the following policy sections are modified:
* Peer definition
* Rule definition
* Ingress
* Egress

[id="switching-between-yaml-and-web-console-form"]
==== Switching between YAML and a web console form

[id="ocp-4-10-security"]
=== Security and compliance

[id="ocp-4-10-networking"]
=== Networking

[id="ocp-4-10-networking-dual-stack-api-change"]
==== Dual-stack services require that ipFamilyPolicy is specified

When you create a service that uses multiple IP address families, you must explicitly specify `ipFamilyPolicy: PreferDualStack` or `ipFamilyPolicy: RequireDualStack` in your Service object definition. This change breaks backwards compatibility with earlier releases of {product-title}.

For more information, see link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2045576[BZ#2045576].

[id="ocp-4-10-redfish-events"]
==== Low-latency Redfish hardware event delivery (Technology Preview)

{product-title} now provides a hardware event proxy that enables applications running on bare-metal clusters to respond quickly to Redfish hardware events, such as hardware changes and failures.

The hardware event proxy supports a publish-subscribe service that allows relevant applications to consume hardware events detected by Redfish. The proxy must be running on hardware that supports Redfish v1.8 and higher. An Operator manages the lifecycle of the `hw-event-proxy` container.

You can use a REST API to develop applications to consume and respond to events such as breaches of temperature thresholds, fan failure, disk loss, power outages, and memory failure. Reliable end-to-end messaging without persistent stores is based on the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP). The latency of the messaging service is in the 10 millisecond range.

[NOTE]
====
This feature is supported for single node OpenShift clusters only.
====

[id="ocp-4-10-networking-ovn-gateway-config"]
==== OVN-Kubernetes support for gateway configuration

The OVN-Kubernetes CNI network provider adds support for configuring how egress traffic is sent to the node gateway.
By default, egress traffic is processed in OVN to exit the cluster and traffic is not affected by specialized routes in the kernel routing table.

This enhancement adds a `gatewayConfig.routingViaHost` field.
With this update, the field can be set at runtime as a post-installation activity and when it is set to `true`, egress traffic is sent from pods to the host networking stack.
This update benefits highly-specialized installations and applications that rely on manually configured routes in the kernel routing table.

This enhancement has an interaction with the Open vSwitch hardware offloading feature.
With this update, when the `gatewayConfig.routingViaHost` field is set to `true`, you do not receive the performance benefits of the offloading because egress traffic is processed by the host networking stack.

For configuration information, see xref:../networking/cluster-network-operator.adoc#nw-operator-configuration-parameters-for-ovn-sdn_cluster-network-operator[Configuration for the OVN-Kubernetes CNI cluster network provider].

[id="ocp-4-10-networking-metrics"]
==== Enhancements to networking metrics

The following metrics are now available for clusters.
The metric names that start with `sdn_controller` are unique to the OpenShift SDN CNI network provider.
The metric names that start with `ovn` are unique to the OVN-Kubernetes CNI network provider:

* `network_attachment_definition_instances{networks="egress-router"}`
* `openshift_unidle_events_total`
* `ovn_controller_bfd_run`
* `ovn_controller_ct_zone_commit`
* `ovn_controller_flow_generation`
* `ovn_controller_flow_installation`
* `ovn_controller_if_status_mgr`
* `ovn_controller_if_status_mgr_run`
* `ovn_controller_if_status_mgr_update`
* `ovn_controller_integration_bridge_openflow_total`
* `ovn_controller_ofctrl_seqno_run`
* `ovn_controller_patch_run`
* `ovn_controller_pinctrl_run`
* `ovnkube_master_ipsec_enabled`
* `ovnkube_master_num_egress_firewall_rules`
* `ovnkube_master_num_egress_firewalls`
* `ovnkube_master_num_egress_ips`
* `ovnkube_master_pod_first_seen_lsp_created_duration_seconds`
* `ovnkube_master_pod_lsp_created_port_binding_duration_seconds`
* `ovnkube_master_pod_port_binding_chassis_port_binding_up_duration_seconds`
* `ovnkube_master_pod_port_binding_port_binding_chassis_duration_seconds`
* `sdn_controller_num_egress_firewall_rules`
* `sdn_controller_num_egress_firewalls`
* `sdn_controller_num_egress_ips`

The `ovnkube_master_resource_update_total` metric is removed for the 4.10 release.

[id="ocp-4-10-networkobservability-switch"]
==== Switching between YAML view and a web console form

* Previously, changes were not retained when switching between *YAML view* and *Form view* on the web console. Additionally, after switching to *YAML view*, you could not return to *Form view*. With this update, you can now easily switch between *YAML view* and *Form view* on the web console without losing changes.

[id="ocp-4-10-networkobservability-targeted-pods"]
==== Listing pods targeted by network policies
When using the network policy functionality in the {product-title} web console, the pods affected by a policy are listed. The list changes as the combined namespace and pod selectors in these policy sections are modified:

* Peer definition
* Rule definition
* Ingress
* Egress

The list of impacted pods includes only those pods accessible by the user.

[id="ocp-4-10-networking-must-gather-tcpdump"]
==== Enhancement to must-gather to simplify network tracing

The `oc adm must-gather` command is enhanced in a way that simplifies collecting network packet captures.

Previously, `oc adm must-gather` could start a single debug pod only.
With this enhancement, you can start a debug pod on multiple nodes at the same time.

You can use the enhancement to run packet captures on multiple nodes at the same time to simplify troubleshooting network communication issues.
A new `--node-selector` argument provides a way to identify which nodes you are collecting packet captures for.

For more information, see xref:../support/gathering-cluster-data.adoc#support-network-trace-methods_gathering-cluster-data[Network trace methods] and xref:../support/gathering-cluster-data.adoc#support-collecting-host-network-trace_gathering-cluster-data[Collecting a host network trace].
[id="ocp-4-10-pod-level-bonding"]
==== Pod-level bonding for secondary networks (Technology Preview)
Bonding at the pod level is vital to enable workloads inside pods that require high availability and more throughput. With pod-level bonding, you can create a bond interface from multiple single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) virtual function interfaces in kernel mode interface. The SR-IOV virtual functions are passed into the pod and attached to a kernel driver.

Scenarios where pod-level bonding is required include creating a bond interface from multiple SR-IOV virtual functions on different physical functions. Creating a bond interface from two different physical functions on the host can be used to achieve high availability at pod level.

[NOTE]
====
The current functionality of Bond CNI is available only in active-backup mode. For further details, see link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2037214[*BZ#2037214*].
====

[id="ocp-4-10-egress-ip-support-public-clouds"]
=== Egress IP address support for clusters installed on public clouds

As a cluster administrator, you can associate one or more egress IP addresses with a namespace. An egress IP address ensures that a consistent source IP address is associated with traffic from a particular namespace that is leaving the cluster.

For the OVN-Kubernetes and OpenShift SDN cluster network providers, you can configure an egress IP address on the following public cloud providers:

* Amazon Web Services (AWS)
* Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
* Microsoft Azure

To learn more, refer to the respective documentation for your cluster network provider:

* OVN-Kubernetes: xref:../networking/ovn_kubernetes_network_provider/configuring-egress-ips-ovn.adoc#configuring-egress-ips-ovn[Configuring an egress IP address]
* OpenShift SDN: xref:../networking/openshift_sdn/assigning-egress-ips.adoc#egress-ips[Configuring egress IPs for a project]

[id="ocp-4-10-openshift-sdn-netpol-egress-policies"]
==== OpenShift SDN cluster network provider network policy support for egress policies and ipBlock except

If you use the OpenShift SDN cluster network provider, you can now use egress rules in network policy with `ipBlock` and `ipBlock.except`. You define egress policies in the `egress` array of the `NetworkPolicy` object.

For more information, refer to xref:../networking/network_policy/about-network-policy.adoc#about-network-policy[About network policy].

[id="ocp-4-10-ne-router-compression"]
==== Ingress Controller router compression
This enhancement adds the ability to configure global HTTP traffic compression on the HAProxy Ingress Controller for specific MIME types. This update enables gzip-compression of your ingress workloads when there are large amounts of compressible routed traffic.

For more information, see xref:../networking/ingress-operator.adoc#nw-configuring-router-compression_configuring-ingress[Using router compression].

[id="ocp-4-10-ne-coredns-customization"]
==== Support for CoreDNS customization
A cluster administrator can now configure DNS servers to allow DNS name resolution through the configured servers for the default domain. A DNS forwarding configuration can have both the default servers specified in the `/etc/resolv.conf` file and the upstream DNS servers.

For more information, see xref:../networking/dns-operator.adoc#nw-dns-forward_dns-operator[Using DNS forwarding].

[id="ocp-4-10-ne-syslog-maxlength"]
==== Support for configuring the maximum length of the syslog message in the Ingress Controller
You can now set the maximum length of the syslog message in the Ingress Controller to any value between 480 and 4096 bytes.

For more information, see xref:../networking/ingress-operator.adoc#nw-ingress-controller-configuration-parameters_configuring-ingress[Ingress Controller configuration parameters].


[id="ocp-4-10-networking-ipi-nmstate"]
==== Configuring host network interfaces with NMState on installer-provisioned clusters

{product-title} now provides a `networkConfig` configuration setting for installer-provisioned clusters, which takes an NMState YAML configuration to configure host interfaces. During installer-provisioned installations, you can add the `networkConfig` configuration setting and the NMState YAML configuration to the `install-config.yaml` file. Additionally, you can add the `networkConfig` configuration setting and the NMState YAML configuration to the bare metal host resource when using the Bare Metal Operator.

The most common use case for the `networkConfig` configuration setting is to set static IP addresses on a host's network interface during installation or while expanding the cluster.

For more information, see xref:../installing/installing_bare_metal_ipi/ipi-install-installation-workflow.html#configuring-host-network-interfaces-in-the-install-config.yaml-file_ipi-install-installation-workflow[Configuring host network interfaces in the install-config.yaml file].

[id="ocp-4-10-mco-config-drift"]
==== Enhanced configuration drift detection

With this enhancement, the Machine Config Daemon (MCD) now checks nodes for configuration drift if a filesystem write event occurs for any of the files specified in the machine config and before a new machine config is applied, in addition to node bootup. Previously, the MCD checked for configuration drift only at node bootup. This change was made because node reboots do not occur frequently enough to avoid the problems caused by configuration drift until an administrator can correct the issue.

Configuration drift occurs when the on-disk state of a node differs from what is configured in the machine config. The Machine Config Operator (MCO) uses the MCD to check nodes for configuration drift and, if detected, sets that node and machine config pool (MCP) to `degraded`.

For more information on configuration drift, see xref:../post_installation_configuration/machine-configuration-tasks.adoc#machine-config-drift-detection_post-install-machine-configuration-tasks[Understanding configuration drift detection].

[id="ocp-4-10-nfd-topology-updater"]
==== NFD Topology Updater is now available

The Node Feature Discovery (NFD) Topology Updater is a daemon responsible for examining allocated resources on a worker node. It accounts for resources that are available to be allocated to new pod on a per-zone basis, where a zone can be a Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) node. See xref:../hardware_enablement/psap-node-feature-discovery-operator.adoc#using-the-nfd-topology-updater_node-feature-discovery-operator[Using the NFD Topology Updater] for more information.


[id="ocp-4-10-hyperthreading-aware-CPU-manager-policy"]
==== Hyperthreading-aware CPU manager policy (Technology Preview)
Hyperthreading-aware CPU manager policy in {product-title} is now available without the need for extra tuning. The cluster administrator can enable this feature if required. Hyperthreads are abstracted by the hardware as logical processors. Hyperthreading allows a single physical processor to execute two heavyweight threads (processes) at the same time, dynamically sharing processor resources.

==== Importing simple content access certificates

In {product-title} 4.10, Insights Operator now imports your simple content access certificates from {console-redhat-com} by default.

For more information, see xref:../support/remote_health_monitoring/insights-operator-simple-access.adoc[Importing simple content access certificates with Insights Operator].

[id="ocp-4-10-insights-operator-data-collection-enhancements"]
==== Insights Operator data collection enhancements

To reduce the amount of data sent to Red Hat, Insights Operator only gathers information when certain conditions are met. For example, Insights Operator only gathers the Alertmanager logs when Alertmanager fails to send alert notifications.


In {product-title} 4.10, the Insights Operator collects the following additional information:

* (Conditional) The logs from pods where the `KubePodCrashlooping` and `KubePodNotReady` alerts are firing
* (Conditional) The Alertmanager logs when the `AlertmanagerClusterFailedToSendAlerts` or `AlertmanagerFailedToSendAlerts` alerts are firing
* Silenced alerts from Alertmanager
* The node logs from the journal unit (kubelet)
* The `CostManagementMetricsConfig` from clusters with `costmanagement-metrics-operator` installed
* The time series database status from the monitoring stack Prometheus instance
* Additional information about the {product-title} scheduler

With this additional information, Red Hat improves {product-title} functionality and enhances Insights Advisor recommendations.

For the full list of OIDC providers, see xref:../authentication/identity_providers/configuring-oidc-identity-provider.adoc#identity-provider-oidc-supported_configuring-oidc-identity-provider[Supported OIDC providers].

[id="ocp-4-10-oc-commands-obtain-credentials-from-podman-config"]
==== oc commands now obtain credentials from Podman configuration locations

Previously, `oc` commands that used the registry configuration, for example `oc registry login` or `oc image` commands, obtained credentials from Docker configuration locations. With {product-title} {product-version}, if a registry entry cannot be found in the default Docker configuration location, `oc` commands obtain the credentials from Podman configuration locations. You can set your preference to either `docker` or `podman` by using the `REGISTRY_AUTH_PREFERENCE` environment variable to prioritize the location.

Users also have the option to use the `REGISTRY_AUTH_FILE` environment variable, which serves as an alternative to the existing `--registry-config` CLI flag. The `REGISTRY_AUTH_FILE` environment variable is also compatible with `podman`.

[id="ocp-4-10-TLS-subject-alternative-names-required"]
==== TLS X.509 certificates must have a Subject Alternative Name

X.509 certificates must have a properly set the Subject Alternative Name field.
If you update your cluster without this, you risk breaking your cluster or rendering it inaccessible.

In older versions of {product-title}, X.509 certificates worked without a Subject Alternative Name, so long as the Common Name field was set.
link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/release_notes/ocp-4-6-release-notes.html#ocp-4-6-tls-common-name[This behavior was removed in {product-title} 4.6].

In some cases, certificates without a Subject Alternative Name continued to work in {product-title} 4.6, 4.7, 4.8, and 4.9.
Because it uses Kubernetes 1.23, {product-title} 4.10 does not allow this under any circumstances.

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-10-cluster-cloud-controller-manager-operator"]
==== Cloud controller managers for additional cloud providers

The Kubernetes community plans to deprecate the Kubernetes controller manager in favor of using cloud controller managers to interact with underlying cloud platforms. As a result, there is no plan to add Kubernetes controller manager support for any new cloud platforms. The IBM Cloud implementation that is added in this release of {product-title} uses cloud controller managers.

In addition, this release supports using cloud controller managers for Google Cloud Platform (GCP), VMware vSphere, and Alibaba Cloud as a link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview[Technology Preview].

To learn more about the cloud controller manager, see the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/cloud-controller/[Kubernetes Cloud Controller Manager documentation].

To manage the cloud controller manager and cloud node manager deployments and lifecycles, use the Cluster Cloud Controller Manager Operator.

For more information, see the xref:../operators/operator-reference.adoc#cluster-cloud-controller-manager-operator_platform-operators-ref[Cluster Cloud Controller Manager Operator] entry in the _Platform Operators reference_.

[id="ocp-4-10-operator-sdk-v-1-16-0"]
==== Operator SDK v1.16.0

{product-title} 4.10 supports Operator SDK v1.16.0. See xref:../cli_reference/osdk/cli-osdk-install.adoc#cli-osdk-install[Installing the Operator SDK CLI] to install or update to this latest version.

[NOTE]
====
Operator SDK v1.16.0 supports Kubernetes 1.22.
====

Many deprecated `v1beta1` APIs were removed in Kubernetes 1.22, including `sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime v0.10.0` and `controller-gen v0.7`. This is a breaking change if you need to scaffold `v1beta1` APIs for custom resource definitions (CRDs) or webhooks to publish your project into older cluster versions.

For more information about changes introduced in Kubernetes 1.22, see link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.9/release_notes/ocp-4-9-release-notes.html#ocp-4-9-osdk-k8s-api-bundle-validate[Validating bundle manifests for APIs removed from Kubernetes 1.22] and link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.9/release_notes/ocp-4-9-release-notes.html#ocp-4-9-removed-kube-1-22-apis[Beta APIs removed from Kubernetes 1.22].

If you have any Operator projects that were previously created or maintained with Operator SDK v1.10.1, see xref:../operators/operator_sdk/osdk-upgrading-projects.adoc#osdk-upgrading-projects[Upgrading projects for newer Operator SDK versions] to ensure your projects are upgraded to maintain compatibility with Operator SDK v1.16.0.

[id="ocp-4-10-docker-config-location-deprecation"]
==== Default Docker configuration location deprecation
Previously, `oc` commands that used a registry configuration would obtain credentials from the Docker configuration location, which was `~/.docker/config.json` by default. This has been deprecated and will be replaced by a Podman configuration location in a future version of {product-title}.

[id="ocp-4-10-empty-file-support-deprecation"]
==== Empty file and stdout support deprecation in oc registry login

Support for empty files using the `--registry-config` and `--to` flags in `oc registry login` has been deprecated. Support for `-` (standard output) has also been deprecated as an argument when using `oc registry login`. They will be removed in a future version of {product-title}.

==== Cloud Compute

* Previously, editing a machine specification on {rh-openstack-first} would cause {product-title} to attempt to delete and recreate the machine. As a result, this caused an unrecoverable loss of the node it was hosting. With this fix, any edits made to the machine specification after creation are ignored. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1962066[*BZ#1962066*])

* Previously, the check to ensure that the AWS machine was not updated before requeueing was removed. Consequently, problems arose when the AWS machine's virtual machine had been removed, but its object was still available. In the event that this happened, the AWS machine would requeue in an infinite loop and could not be deleted or updated. This update restores the check that was used to ensure that the AWS machine was not updated before requeueing. As a result, machines no longer requeue if they have been updated. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2007802[*BZ#2007802*])

* Previously, modifying a selector changed the list of machines that a machine set observed. As a result, leaks could occur because the machine set lost track of machines it had already created. This update ensures that the selector is immutable once created. As a result, machine sets now lists the correct machines. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2005052[*BZ#2005052*])

* Previously, if a virtual machine template had snapshots, an incorrect disk size was picked due to an incorrect usage of the `linkedClone` operation. With this update, the default clone operation is changed to `fullClone` for all situations. `linkedClone` must now by specified by the user. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2001008[*BZ#2001008*])

* Previously, the custom resource definition (CRD) schema requirements did not allow numeric values. Consequently, marshaling errors occurred during upgrades. This update corrects the schema requirements to allow both string and numeric values. As a result, marshaling errors are no longer reported by the API server conversion. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1999425[*BZ#1999425*])

* Previously, if the Machine API Operator was moved, or the pods were deployed as a result of a name change, the `MachineNotYetDeleted` metric would reset for each monitored machine. This update changes the metric query to ignore the source pod label. As a result, the `MachineNotYetDeleted` metric now properly alerts in scenarios where the Machine API Operator pod has been renamed. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1986237[*BZ#1986237*])

* Previously, egress IPs on vSphere were picked up by the vSphere cloud provider within the kubelet. These were unexpected by the certificate signing requests (CSR) approver. Consequently, nodes with egress IPs would not have their CSR renewals approved. This update allows the CSR approver to account for egress IPs. As a result, nodes with egress IPs on vSphere SDN clusters now continue to function and have valid CSR renewals. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1860774[*BZ#1860774*])

* Previously, worker nodes failed to launch, and the installer failed to generate URL images due to the broken path defaulting for the disk image and incompatible changes in the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) SDK. As a result, the machine controller was unable to create machines. This fix repairs the URL images by changing the base path in the GCP SDK. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2009111[*BZ#2009111*])

* Previously, the machine would freeze during the deletion process due to a lag in the vCenter's `powerOff` task. VMware showed the machine to be powered off, but {product-title} reported it to be powered on, which resulted in the machine freezing during the deletion process. This update improves the `powerOff` task handling on vSphere to be checked before the destroy task is created, which prevents the machine from freezing during the deletion process. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2011668[*BZ#2011668*])

* After installing or updating {product-title}, the value of the metrics showed one pending CSR after the last CSR was reconciled. This resulted in the metrics reporting one pending CSR when there should be no pending CSRs. This fix ensures the pending CSR count is always valid post-approval by updating the metrics at the end of each reconcile loop. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2013528[*BZ#2013528*])

* Previously, AWS checked for credentials when the `cloud-provider` flag was set to empty string. The credentials were checked by making calls to the metadata service, even on non-AWS platforms. This caused latency in the ECR provider startup and AWS credential errors logged in all platforms, including non-AWS. This fix prevents the credentials check from making any requests to the metadata service to ensure that credential errors are no longer being logged. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2015515[*BZ#2015515*])

* Previously, the Cluster Autoscaler Unschedulable pods showed a severity warning alert that suggested it required developer intervention. This alert is informational and does not describe a problematic condition that requires developer intervention. This issue resulted in the Cluster Autosaver Unschedulable pods not meeting the warning alert criteria. This fix changes the Cluster Autosaver Unschedulable pods by lowering its severity. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2025230[*BZ#2025230*])

* Previously, the Machine API sometimes reconciled a machine before AWS had communicated VM creation across its API. As a result, AWS reported the VM does not exist and the Machine API considered it failed. With this release, the Machine API waits until the AWS API has synched before trying to mark the machine as provisioned. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2025767[*BZ#2025767*])

* Previously, a large volume of nodes created simultaneously on UPI clusters could lead to a large number of CSRs being generated. As a result, certificate renewals were not automated because the approver stops approving certificates when there are over 100 pending certificate requests. With this release, existing nodes are accounted for when calculating the approval cut-off and UPI clusters can now benefit from automated certificate renewal even with large scale refresh requests. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2028019[*BZ#2028019*])

* Previously, the generated list of instance types embedded in Machine API controllers was out of date. Some of these instance types were unknown and could not be annotated for scale-from-zero requirements. With this release, the generated list is updated to include support for newer instance types. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2040376[*BZ#2040376*])

* Previously, AWS Machine API controllers did not set the IOPS value for block devices other than the IO1 type, causing IOPS fields for GP3 block devices to be ignored. With this release, the IOPS is set on all supported block device types and users can set IOPS for block devices that are attached to the machine.

[id="ocp-4-10-cloud-credential-operator-bug-fixes"]
==== Cloud Credential Operator

* Previously, when using the Cloud Credential Operator in manual mode on an Azure cluster, the `Upgradeable` status was not set to `False`. This behavior was different for other platforms. With this release, Azure clusters using the Cloud Credential Operator in manual mode have the `Upgradeable` status set to `False`.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1976674[*BZ#1976674*])

* Previously, the now unnecessary `controller-manager-service` service resource that was created by the Cloud Credential Operator was still present. With this release, the Cluster Version Operator cleans it up.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1977319[*BZ#1977319*])

* Previously, changes to the log level setting for the Cloud Credential Operator in the `CredentialsRequest` custom resource were ignored. With this release, logging verbosity can be controlled by editing the `CredentialsRequest` custom resource.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1991770[*BZ#1991770*])

* Previously, the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) pod restarted with a continuous error when AWS was the default secret annotator for {rh-openstack-first}. This update fixes the default setting for the CCO pod and prevents the CCO pod from crashing. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1996624[*BZ#1996624*])

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-10-cluster-version-operator-bug-fixes"]
==== Cluster Version Operator

* Previously, a pod might fail to launch due to an invalid mount request that was not a part of the manifest. With this update, the Cluster Version Operator (CVO) removes any volumes and volume mounts from in-cluster resources that are not included in the manifest. This allows pods to launch successfully. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2002834[*BZ#2002834*])

* Previously, when monitoring certificates were rotated, the Cluster Version Operator (CVO) would log errors and monitoring would be unable to query metrics until the CVO pod was manually restarted. With this update, the CVO monitors the certificate files and automatically recreates the metrics connection whenever the certificate files change. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2027342[*BZ#2027342*])

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-10-console-storage-bug-fixes"]
==== Console Storage Plug-in

* Previously, a loading prompt was not present while the persistent volumes (PVs) were being provisioned and the capacity was `0` TiB which created a confusing scenario. With this update, a loader is added for the loading state which provides details to the user if the PVs are still being provisioned or capacity is to be determined. It will also inform the user of any errors in the process. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1928285[*BZ#1928285*])

* Previously, the grammar was not correct in certain places and there were instances where translators were unable to interpret the context. This had a negative impact on readability. With this update, the grammar in various places is corrected, the storage classes for translators is itemized, and the overall readability is improved. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1961391[*BZ#1961391*])

* Previously, when pressing a pool inside the block pools page, the final `Ready` phase persisted after deletion. Consequently, the pool was in the `Ready` state even after deletion. This update redirects users to the *Pools* page and refreshes the pools after detention. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1981396[*BZ#1981396*])

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-10-image-registry-bug-fixes"]
==== Image Registry

* Previously, the registry internally resolved `\docker.io` references into `\registry-1.docker.io` and used it to store credentials. As a result, credentials for `\docker.io` images could not be located. With this update, the `\registry-1.docker.io` hostname has been changed back to `\docker.io` when searching for credentials. As a result, the registry can correctly find credentials for `\docker.io images`. (https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2024859[*BZ#2024859*])

* Previously, the image pruner job did not retry upon failure. As a result, a single failure could degrade the Image Registry Operator until the next time it ran. With this fix, the temporary problems with the pruner do not degrade the Image Registry Operator. (https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2051692[*BZ#2051692*])

* Previously, the Image Registry Operator was modifying objects from the informer. As a result, these objects could be concurrently modified by the informer and cause race conditions. With this fix, controllers and informers have different copies of the object and do not have race conditions. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2028030[*BZ#2028030*])

* Previously, `TestAWSFinalizerDeleteS3Bucket` would fail because of an issue with the location of the configuration object in the Image Registry Operator. This update ensures that the configuration object is stored in the correct location. As a result, the Image Registry Operator no longer panics when running `TestAWSFinalizerDeleteS3Bucket`.

==== Image Streams

* Previously, the image policy admission plug-in did not recognize deployment configurations, notably that stateful sets could be updated. As a result, image stream references stayed unresolved in deployment configurations when the `resolve-names` annotation was used. Now, the plug-in is updated so that it resolves annotations in deployment configurations and stateful sets. As a result, image stream tags get resolved in created and edited deployment configurations. (https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2000216[*BZ#2000216*])

* Previously, when global pull secrets were updated, existing API server pod pull secrets were not updated. Now, the mount point for the pull secret is changed from the `/var/lib/kubelet/config.json` file to the `/var/lib/kubelet` directory. As a result, the updated pull secret now appears in existing API server pods. (https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1984592[*BZ#1984592*])

==== Installer

* Previously, RAM validation for {rh-openstack-first} checked for values using a wrong unit, and as a result the validation accepted flavors that did not meet minimum RAM requirements. With this fix, RAM validation now rejects flavors with insufficient RAM. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2009699[*BZ#2009699*])

* Previously, {product-title} master nodes were missing Ingress security group rules when they were schedulable and deployed on {rh-openstack}. As a result, {product-title} deployments on {rh-openstack} failed for compact clusters with no dedicated workers. This fix adds Ingress security group rules on {rh-openstack-first} when masters are schedulable. Now, you can deploy compact three-node clusters on {rh-openstack}. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1955544[*BZ#1955544*])

* Previously, if you specified an invalid AWS region, the installation program continued to try and validate availability zones. This caused the installer to become unresponsive for 60 minutes before timing out. The installer now verifies the AWS region and service endpoints before availability zones, which reduces the amount of time the installer takes to report the error. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2019977[*BZ#2019977*])

* Previously, you could not install a cluster to VMware vSphere if the vCenter host name began with a number. The installer has been updated and no longer treats this type of host name as invalid. Now, a cluster deploys successfully when the vCenter host name begins with a number.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2021607[*BZ#2021607*])

* Previously, if you specified a custom disk instance type when deploying a cluster on Microsoft Azure, the cluster might not deploy. This occurred because the installer incorrectly determined that the minimum resource requirements had been met. The installer has been updated, and now reports an error when the number of vcpus available for the instance type in the selected region does not meet the minimum resource requirements. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2025788[*BZ#2025788*])

* Previously, if you defined custom IAM roles when deploying an AWS cluster, you might have to manually remove bootstrap instance profiles after uninstalling the cluster. Intermittently, the installer did not remove bootstrap instance profiles. The installer has been updated, and all machine instance profiles are removed when the cluster is uninstalled.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2028695[*BZ#2028695*])

* Previously, the default provisioningIP value was different when the host bits were set in the provisioning network CIDR. This resulted in a different value for the provisioningIP than expected. This difference caused a conflict with the other IP addresses on the provisioning network. This fix adds a validation to ensure that the ProvisioningNetworkCIDR does not have host bits set. As a result, if the ProvisioningNetworkCIDR has the host bits set, the installer will stop and report the validation error. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2006291[*BZ#2006291*])

* Previously, the BMC driver IPMI was not supported for a secure UEFI boot. This resulted in an unsuccessful boot. This fix adds a validation check to ensure that `UEFISecureBoot` mode is not used with bare-metal drivers. As a result, a secure UEFI boot is successful. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2011893[*BZ#2011893*])

* With this update, the 4.8 UPI template is updated from version 3.1.0 to 3.2.0 in order to match the Ignition version. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1949672[*BZ#1949672*])

* Previously, when asked to mirror the contents of the base registry, the {product-title} installer would exit with a validation error, citing incorrect `install-config` file values for `imageContentSources`. With this update, the installer now allows `imageContentSources` values to specify base registry names and the installer no longer exits when specifying a base registry name. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1960378[*BZ#1960378*])

* Previously, the UPI ARM templates were attaching an SSH key to the virtual machine (VM) instances created. As a result, the creation of the VMs fails when the SSH key provided by the user is the `ed25519` type. With this update, the creation of the VMs succeeds regardless of the type of the SSH key provided by the user. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1968364[*BZ#1968364*])

* After successfully creating a `aws_vpc_dhcp_options_association` resource, AWS might still report that the resource does not exist. Consequently, the AWS Terraform provider fails the installation. With this update, you can retry the query of the `aws_vpc_dhcp_options_association` resource for a period of time after creation until AWS reports that the resource exists. As a result, installations succeed despite AWS reporting that the `aws_vpc_dhcp_options_association` resource does not exist. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2032521[*BZ#2032521*])

* Previously, when installing {product-title} on AWS with local zones enabled, the installer could create some resources on a local zone instead of an availability zone. This caused the installer to fail because load balancers cannot run on local zones. With this fix, the installer ignores local zones and only considers availability zones when installing cluster components. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1997059[*BZ#1997059*])

* Previously, terraform could attempt to upload the bootstrap ignition configuration file to Azure before it had finished creating the configuration file. If the upload started before the local file was created, the installation would fail. With this fix, terraform uploads the ignition configuration file directly to Azure rather than creating a local copy first. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2004313[*BZ#2004313*])

* Previously, a race condition could occur if the `cluster-bootstrap` and Cluster Version Operator components attempted to write a manifest for the same resource to the Kubernetes API at the same time. This could result in the `Authentication` resource being overwritten by a default copy, which removed any customizations made to that resource. With this fix, the Cluster Version Operator has been blocked from overwriting the manifests that come from the installer. This prevents any user-specified customizations to the `Authentication` resource from being overwritten. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2008119[*BZ#2008119*])

* Previously, when installing {product-title} on AWS, the installer created the bootstrap machine using the `m5.large` instance type. This caused the installation to fail in regions where that instance type is not available. With this fix, the bootstrap machine uses the same instance type as the control plane machines. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2016955[*BZ#2016955*])

* Previously, when installing {product-title} on AWS, the installer did not recognize EC2 G and VT instances and defaulted them to X instances. This caused incorrect instance quotas to be applied to these instances. With this fix, the installer recognizes EC2 G and VT instances and applies the correct instance quotas.

* Before this update, upgrading to the current release did not set the correct weights for the `TaintandToleration`, `NodeAffinity`, and `InterPodAffinity` parameters. This update resolves the issue so that upgrading correctly sets the weights for `TaintandToleration` to `3`, `NodeAffinity` to `2`, and `InterPodAffinity` to `2`. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2039414[*BZ#2039414*])

* In {product-title} 4.10, code for serving insecure metrics is removed from the `kube-scheduler` code base. Now, metrics are served only through a secure server. Bug fixes and support are provided through the end of a future life cycle. After which, no new feature enhancements are made. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1889488[*BZ#1889488*])

[id="ocp-4-10-machine-config-operator-bug-fixes"]
==== Machine Config Operator

* Previously, a warning message sent by the `clone_slave_connection` function was incorrectly stored in a `new_uuid` variable, which is intended to store only the connection's UUID. As a result, `nmcli` commands that include the `new_uuid` variable were failing due to the incorrect value being stored in the `new_uuid` variable. With this fix, the `clone_slave_connection` function warning message is redirected to `stderr`. Now, `nmcli` commands that reference the `new_uuid` variable do not fail. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2022646[*BZ#2022646*])

* Previously, an old version of the Kubernetes client library was present in the `baremetal-runtimecfg` project. When a Virtual IP (VIP) failed, the client connections might not be closed in a timely manner. This could result in long delays for monitor containers that rely on talking to the API. This fix updates the client library. Now, connections are closed as expected on VIP failovers and the monitor containers do not hang for an excessive period of time. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1995021[*BZ#1995021*])

* Before this update, the Machine Config Operator (MCO) stored pending configuration changes to disk before it applied them to {op-system-first}. If a power loss interrupted the MCO from applying the configuration, it treated the configuration as applied and did not validate the changes. If this configuration contained invalid changes, applying them failed. With this update, the MCO saves a configuration to disk only after being applied. This way, if the power is lost while the MCO is applying the configuration, it reapplies the configuration after it restarts. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1916169[*BZ#1916169*])

* Before this update, when you used the Machine Config Operator (MCO) to create or update an SSH key, it set the owner and group of the `authorized_keys` file to `root`. This update resolves the issue. When the MCO creates or updates the `authorized_keys` file, it correctly sets or preserves `core` as the owner and group of the file. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1956739[*BZ#1956739*])

* Previously, in clusters that use Stateless Address AutoConfiguration (SLAAC), the Ironic `addr-gen-mode` parameter was not being persisted to the OVNKubernetes bridge. As a result, the IPv6 addresses could change when the bridge was created. This broke the cluster because node IP changes are unsupported. This fix persists the `addr-gen-mode` parameter when creating the bridge. The IP address is now consistent throughout the deployment process. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1990625[*BZ#1990625*])

* Previously, if a machine config included a compressed file with the `spec.config.storage.files.contents.compression` parameter set to `gzip`, the Machine Config Daemon (MCD) incorrectly wrote the compressed file to disk without extracting it. With this fix, the MCD now extracts a compressed file when the compression parameter is set to `gzip`. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1970218[*BZ#1970218*])

* Previously, systemd units were cleaned up only when completely removed. As a result, systemd units could not be unmasked by using a machine config because the masks were not being removed unless the systemd unit was completely removed. With this fix, when you configure a systemd unit as `mask: true` in a machine config, any existing masks are removed. As a result, systemd units can be unmasked.

* Previously, the *OperatorHub* category and card links did not include valid `href` attributes. Consequently, the *OperatorHub* cateogry and card links could not be opened in a new tab. This update adds valid `href` attributes to the *OperatorHub* category and card links. As a result, the *OperatorHub* and its card links can be opened in new tabs. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2013127[*BZ#2013127*])

* Previously, on the *Operand Details* page, a special case was created where the conditions table for the `status.conditions` property always rendered before all other tables. Consequently, the `status.conditions` table did not follow the ordering rules of descriptors, which caused unexpected behavior when users tried to change the order of the tables. This update removes the special case for `status.conditions` and only defaults to rendering it first if no descriptor is defined for that property. As a result, the table for `status.condition` is rendered according to descriptor ordering rules when a descriptor is defined on that property. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2014488[*BZ#2014488*])

* Previously, the *Resource Details* page metrics tab was exceeding the cluster-scoped Thanos endpoint. Consequently, users without authorization for this endpoint would receive a `401` response for all queries. With this update, the Thanos tenancy endpoints are updated, and redundant namespace query arguments are removed. As a result, users with the correct role-based access control (RBAC) permissions can now see data in the metrics tab of the *Resource Details* page. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2015806[*BZ#2015806*])

* Previously, when an Operator added an API to an existing API group, it did not trigger API discovery. Consequently, new APIs were not seen by the front end until the page was refreshed. This update makes APIs added by Operators viewable by the front end without a page refresh. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1815189[*BZ#1815189*])

* Previously, in the {console-redhat-com} for {rh-openstack-first}, the control plane was not translated into simplified Chinese. As a result, naming differed from {product-title} documentation.

* Previously, when logging into a worker node, messages might appear indicating a `systemd-coredump` services failure. This was due to the unnecessary inclusion of the `system-systemd` namespace for containers. A filter now prevents this namespace from impacting the workflow. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1978528[*BZ#1978528*])

* Previously, when clusters were restarted, the status of terminated pods might have been reset to `Running`, which would result in an error. This has been corrected and now all terminated pods remain terminated and active pods reflect their correct status. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1997478[*BZ#1997478*])

* Previously, certain stop signals were ignored in {product-title}, causing services in the container to continue running. With an update to the signal parsing library, all stop signals are now respected. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2000877[*BZ#2000877*])

* Previously, pod namespaces managed by CRI-O, for example network, IPC, and UTS, were not unmounted when the pod was removed. This resulted in leakage, driving the Open vSwitch CPU to 100%, which caused pod latency and other performance impacts. This has been resolved and pod namespaces are unmounted when removed.

(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1987257[*BZ#1987257*])

* Previously, `oc debug` assumed that it was always targeting Linux-based containers by trying to run a Bash shell, and if Bash was not present in the container, it attempted to debug as a Windows container. The `oc debug` command now uses pod selectors to determine the operating system of the containers and now works properly on both Linux and Windows-based containers. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1990014[*BZ#1990014*])

* Previously, the `--dry-run` flag was not working properly for several `oc set` subcommands, so `--dry-run=server` was performing updates to resources instead of performing a dry run. The `--dry-run` flags are now working properly to perform dry runs on the `oc set` subcommands. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2035393[*BZ#2035393*])

==== Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)

* Before this update, default catalog sources for the `marketplace-operator` did not tolerate tainted nodes and the `CatalogSource` pod would only have the default settings for tolerations, `nodeSelector`, and `priorityClassName`. With this update, the `CatalogSource` specification now includes the optional `spec.grpcPodConfig` field that can override tolerations, `nodeSelector`, and `priorityClassName` for the pod. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1927478[*BZ#1927478*])

* Before this update, the `csv_suceeded` metric would be lost when the OLM Operator was restarted. With this update, the `csv_succeeded` metric is emitted at the beginning of the OLM Operator's startup logic. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1927478[*BZ#1927478*])

* Before this update, the `oc adm catalog mirror` command did not set minimum and maximum values for the `--max-icsp-size` flag. As a result, the field accepted values that were less than zero or were too large. With this update, values are limited to sizes greater than zero and less than 250001. Values outside of this range fail validation. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1972962[*BZ#1972962*])

* Before this update, bundled images did not contain the related images needed for Operator deployment in file-based catalogs. As a result, images were not mirrored to disconnected clusters unless specified in the `relatedImages` field of the ClusterServiceVersion (CSV). With this update, the `opm render` command adds the CSV Operator images to the `relatedImages` file when the file-based catalog bundle image is rendered. The images necessary for Operator deployment are now mirrored to disconnected clusters even if they are not listed in the `relatedImages` field of the CSV. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2002075[*BZ#2002075*])

* Before this update, it could take up to 15 minutes for Operators to perform `skipRange` updates. This was a known issue that could be resolved if cluster administrators deleted the `catalog-operator` pod in the `openshift-operator-lifecycle-manager` namespace. This caused the pod to be automatically recreated and triggered the `skipRange` upgrade. With this update, obsolete API calls have been fixed in Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM), and `skipRange` updates trigger immediately.

* Before this update, if you repeatedly clicked links to get details for resources such as custom resource definitions or pods and the application encountered multiple code reference errors, it crashed and displayed a `t is not a function` error. This update resolves the issue. When an error occurs, the application resolves a code reference and stores the resolution state so that it can correctly handle additional errors. The application no longer crashes when code reference errors occur. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2017130[BZ#2017130])

* Before this update, users with restricted access could not access their config map in a shared namespace to save their user settings on a cluster and load them in another browser or machine. As a result, user preferences such as pinned navigation items were only saved in the local browser storage and not shared between multiple browsers. This update resolves the issue: The web console Operator automatically creates RBAC rules so that each user can save these settings to a config map in a shared namespace and more easily switch between browsers. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2018234[BZ#2018234])

* Before this update, creating connections between virtual machines (VMs) in the Topology view failed because it relied on a method that did not support custom resource definition (CRDs). This update resolves the issue by adding support for CRDs. Now you can create connections between VMs. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2020904[BZ#2020904])

== Known issues

// TODO: This known issue should carry forward to 4.8 and beyond! This needs some SME/QE review before being updated for 4.9.
* In {product-title} 4.1, anonymous users could access discovery endpoints. Later releases revoked this access to reduce the possible attack surface for security exploits because some discovery endpoints are forwarded to aggregated API servers. However, unauthenticated access is preserved in upgraded clusters so that existing use cases are not broken.
+
If you are a cluster administrator for a cluster that has been upgraded from {product-title} 4.1 to 4.8, you can either revoke or continue to allow unauthenticated access. It is recommended to revoke unauthenticated access unless there is a specific need for it. If you do continue to allow unauthenticated access, be aware of the increased risks.
+
[WARNING]
====
If you have applications that rely on unauthenticated access, they might receive HTTP `403` errors if you revoke unauthenticated access.
====
+
Use the following script to revoke unauthenticated access to discovery endpoints:
+
[source,bash]
----
## Snippet to remove unauthenticated group from all the cluster role bindings
$ for clusterrolebinding in cluster-status-binding discovery system:basic-user system:discovery system:openshift:discovery ;
do
### Find the index of unauthenticated group in list of subjects
index=$(oc get clusterrolebinding ${clusterrolebinding} -o json | jq 'select(.subjects!=null) | .subjects | map(.name=="system:unauthenticated") | index(true)');
### Remove the element at index from subjects array
oc patch clusterrolebinding ${clusterrolebinding} --type=json --patch "[{'op': 'remove','path': '/subjects/$index'}]";
done
----
+
This script removes unauthenticated subjects from the following cluster role bindings:
+
--
** `cluster-status-binding`
** `discovery`
** `system:basic-user`
** `system:discovery`
** `system:openshift:discovery`
--

// TODO: This known issue should carry forward to 4.9 and beyond!
* The `oc annotate` command does not work for LDAP group names that contain an equal sign (`=`), because the command uses the equal sign as a delimiter between the annotation name and value. As a workaround, use `oc patch` or `oc edit` to add the annotation. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1917280[*BZ#1917280*])

* The assignment of egress IP addresses to control plane nodes with the egress IP feature is not supported on a cluster provisioned on Amazon Web Services (AWS). (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2039656[*BZ#2039656*])

* Previously, there was a race condition between {rh-openstack-first} credentials secret creation and `kube-controller-manager` startup. As a result, {rh-openstack-first} cloud provider would not be configured with {rh-openstack} credentials and would break support when creating Octavia load balancers for `LoadBalancer` services. To work around this, you must restart the `kube-controller-manager` pods by deleting the pods manually from the manifests. When you use the workaround, the `kube-controller-manager` pods restart and {rh-openstack} credentials are properly configured. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2004542[*BZ#2004542*])

* The ability to delete operands from the web console using the `delete all operands` option is currently disabled. It will be re-enabled in a future version of {product-title}. For more information, see link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2012120[BZ#2012120] and link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2012971[BZ#2012971].

* Google Cloud Platform (GCP) UPI installation fails when the instance group name is longer than the maximum size of 64 characters. You are restricted in the naming process after adding the "-instance-group" suffix. Shorten the suffix to "-ig" to reduce the number of characters. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1921627[*BZ#1921627*])

* If an incorrect network is specified in the vSphere `install-config.yaml` file, then an error message from Terraform is generated after a while. Add a check during the creation of manifests to notify the user if the network is invalid. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1956776[*BZ#1956776*])

* The Special Resource Operator (SRO) might fail to install on Google Cloud Platform due to a software-defined network policy. As a result, the simple-kmod pod is not created. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1996916[*BZ#1996916*])


[id="ocp-4-10-asynchronous-errata-updates"]
== Asynchronous errata updates

Security, bug fix, and enhancement updates for {product-title} {product-version} are released as asynchronous errata through the Red Hat Network. All {product-title} {product-version} errata is https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290/[available on the Red Hat Customer Portal]. See the https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[{product-title} Life Cycle] for more information about asynchronous errata.

Red Hat Customer Portal users can enable errata notifications in the account settings for Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM). When errata notifications are enabled, users are notified via email whenever new errata relevant to their registered systems are released.

[NOTE]
====
Red Hat Customer Portal user accounts must have systems registered and consuming {product-title} entitlements for {product-title} errata notification emails to generate.
====

This section will continue to be updated over time to provide notes on enhancements and bug fixes for future asynchronous errata releases of {product-title} {product-version}. Versioned asynchronous releases, for example with the form {product-title} {product-version}.z, will be detailed in subsections. In addition, releases in which the errata text cannot fit in the space provided by the advisory will be detailed in subsections that follow.

[IMPORTANT]
====
For any {product-title} release, always review the instructions on xref:../updating/updating-cluster-within-minor.adoc#updating-cluster-within-minor[updating your cluster] properly.
