== `useResolvedExtensions`

React hook for consuming Console extensions with resolved `CodeRef` properties.This hook accepts the same argument(s) as `useExtensions` hook and returns an adapted list of extension instances, resolving all code references within each extension's properties. Initially, the hook returns an empty array. Once the resolution is complete, the React component is re-rendered with the hook returning an adapted list of extensions. When the list of matching extensions changes, the resolution is restarted. The hook will continue to return the previous result until the resolution completes. The hook's result elements are guaranteed to be referentially stable across re-renders. It returns Tuple containing a list of adapted extension instances with resolved code references, a boolean flag indicating whether the resolution is complete, and a list of errors detected during the resolution.

=== Example

[source,ts]
----
const [navItemExtensions, navItemsResolved] = useResolvedExtensions<NavItem>(isNavItem);
// process adapted extensions and render your component
