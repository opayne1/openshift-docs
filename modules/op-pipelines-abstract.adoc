= Accessing {pipelines-title} in the web console
You can access the following options for creating pipelines from the *+Add* page:

* Use the *+Add* -> *Pipelines* -> *Pipeline builder* option to create customized pipelines for your application.
* Use the *+Add* -> *From Git* option to create pipelines using pipeline templates and resources while creating an application.

After you create the pipelines for your application, you can view and visually interact with the deployed pipelines in the *Pipelines* view. You can also use the *Topology* view to interact with the pipelines created using the *From Git* option. You must apply custom labels to pipelines created using the *Pipeline builder* to see them in the *Topology* view.
